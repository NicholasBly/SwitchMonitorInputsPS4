Software project I wrote to manage a 2 monitor setup that helps swap monitors to access different sources like a PlayStation and Xbox console. For example, a 2 monitor Windows setup will slide over to monitor 2 in order to change sources to the selected console.

Also supports mic in audio to hear the selected console's audio input.
